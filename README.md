# CD4_CD8-Manuscript

TCR sequences and iPython notebooks are provided for each of the figures in our associated manuscript (bioRxiv 293852).

TCR sequences for Subjects 1-5 obtained using the AbVitro method were obtained from Grigaityte et al. (bioRxiv 213462). Sequence from the 10x Genomics platform (S1,3,5,6) are new sequences available here. All 70,108 CD4 and 26,946 CD8 TCR pairs used in the manuscript are provided as pickled pandas dataframes in the Data folder. For simplicity, the Data folder additionally contains the CDR3 sequences with known antigen specificity as downloaded from VDJdb. iPython notebooks are provided in the Scripts folder.
